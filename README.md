##What is jZm?  
jZm is a plugin architecture that allows developers to enhance certain aspects in the 'COD: Black Ops II Zombies' game.  
  
##How does it work?
If you want to run plugins you simple place them in the 'plugins' directory.  
jZm itself is a simple executable, So when you run jZm, It'll load all plugins as well.

##Can I get banned for this?  
At the moment we are not entirely sure, Nobody has been banned so far, however, you are (of course) responsible for it yourself, if it ever occurs.

##I'm a developer, how can I make my own plugin?  
Have a look at the [create your own plugin guide](https://github.com/jariz/jZm/wiki/CrashCoursePluginCreation)
